## Usage 

This application enables its users to generate an SVG Logo of their own design. Following the prompts in the terminal - 

- What do you want the text to be? ( Up to 3 characters ) eg. 'GIT'
- What color do you want the text to be? eg. 'black'
- What shape would you like your logo to have? eg. 'square'
- Which color would you like the background to be? eg. 'black'

After user input is recieved a unique SVG logo is generated and rendered to the page displaying the following example code in the terminal:

{
  text: 'GIT',
  textcolor: 'orange',
  shape: 'square',
  shapecolor: 'black'
}

<svg version="1.1" width="300" height="200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
        <rect width="200" height="200" x="50" fill="black"/>
        <text x="140" y="145" font-size="58" text-anchor="middle" fill="orange">GIT</text>
